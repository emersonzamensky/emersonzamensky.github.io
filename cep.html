 <div class="title"> Evolution of Cepalopod Intelligence </div>


<div class="text"> This project required us to use our knowledge of evolution and phylogenetic relations between species to prove (or disprove) a hypothesis utilizing online data and R Studio. My group decided to focus on the evolution of intelligence in cephalopods. I have always enjoyed this topic as cephalopods are some of the most intelligent creatures on the planet. Additionally, I believe the way humans have measured animal intelligence needs some updating, so diving deeper into this category of study was rather interesting. This project was generally tough because we didn't get to conduct our own research and measure our own data. Using only the internet's information put us in quite a box. Although we recieved a good grade, I felt a little unfulfilled with our conclusion. </div>
