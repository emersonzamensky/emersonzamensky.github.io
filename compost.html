 <div class="title"> Compost and Wildfire Mitigation </div>


<div class="text"> In 2016, California passed State Bill 1383 in an effort to reduce statewide short-lived climate pollutants in various economical sectors. The City of Oakland was given 20k-30k from the CalRecycle SB 1383 implementation grant and less than 1.5 years to spend it. Per this bill, the city is required to make use of it's excess compost that would otherwise sit in a landfill and emit methane-- a greenhouse gas that is over 80 times more powerful than carbon dixide in warming power. My team was given the task of piloting creative uses for this compost, particularly relating to carbon sequestration. After a month of conducting our own research and meeting with representatives from different organizations, research groups, and cities from around the country, we decided to focus our project on compost's impact on wildfire mitigation and wildfire damaged land. As of mid March, we have been approved to place compost on a city site and run various tests to further this project. <br> <br> Learn more about the project background, concept, goal(s), and implementation process (updated January 2023) through our most up to date project report embedded below, alongside our inital presentation to City stakeholders.
