 <div class="title"> Building Electrification </div>


<div class="text"> Building electrification means replacing all gas powered appliances in homes with electric ones. Using electricity for core functions such as heating, cooling, cooking, and potentially for industrial processes that are traditionally powered by fossil fuels is one of the most important factors in decarbonizing the world and mitigating climate change. Oakland's ECAP (Equitable Climate Action Plan) requires all buildings to be electric by 2040. Fossil fuels are currently phased out of all new construction and it's been this project team's task to help home owners, renters, and businesses phase them out of all exsiting buildings. 
<br> We have been accomplishing this through designing and creating electrification flyers and  merchandise, tabling at various city events, and hosting public electrification clinics-- all to spread the word of the rebates and incentives offered. Similarly, we have been doing extensive research on other U.S city's electrification frameworks (New York City, San Jose, and Denver primarily) and pulling information that could be helpful in our own. <br> I worked in collaboration on the projects below with the following: Carmen Hamm, Kerstin Firmin, Allison Shields, Gabrille Buck and Emma Smith (all CCAC City of Oakland Fellows).</div>
