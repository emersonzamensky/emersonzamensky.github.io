 <div class="title"> The Effects of Infrastructure on Boulder Creek </div>


<div class="text"> This project required us to create a research question, propose a hypothesis, and conduct an experiment to report our findings. My partner and I decided to look into the effects that surrounding infrastructure has on Boulder creek by comparing it to areas along the stream without infrastructure. I enjoyed this project a lot because I was able to get outside and collect my own data. I also loved analyzing the data and reporting findings about a creek so close to home. I love Boulder and want to preserve it in any way I can, so even simply conducting this experiment made me feel impactful. </div>
