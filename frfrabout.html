<div class="text">My name is Emerson and I am a recent graduate from the University of Colorado, Boulder where I studied Ecology and Evolutionary Biology through the school of Arts and Sciences with a minor in Creative Technology and Design through the School of Engineering and Applied Mathematics. <br> <br> I absolutely loved my time at CU. Outside of schoolwork, I participated in many leadership organizations. I spent all four years on the Herd Leadership Council (the student lead branch of the Alumni Association), one of which I acted as Co-Spirit Chair and two of which I acted as Co-President. Additionally, I was a Student Ambassador my freshman year and a Journey Leader my sophomore year. During my senior year I held the events lead position at the Environmental Center and the undergraduate bioplastic lead in ATLAS' living matter/ emerging nanomaterials lab. I also played way too many intramural sports all four years, finally gaining a championship title my second to last semester of outdoor soccer (my team carried me). <br> <br> After graduation I moved to San Francisco where I currently work as a Fellow with the City of Oakland's Sustainablility and Resilience division. My team provides delivery, outreach, and engagement to support and implement projects that target goals within the City of Oakland’s Equitable Climate Action Plan. This includes conducting carbon sequestration research, performing water and soil quality tests, and engaging with the community to promote rebates and incentivies associated with building electrification. We are also given ample learning and professional development opportunities, such as attending the Greenbuild international confernece and taking a California climate stewardship course. I am learning and gaining so much from this experience and I couldn't be more thankful for this opportunity. <br> <br> My primary interests within my major include conservation biology, field biology, and biodiversity maintence. My primary interests within my minor inclulde physical computing, 3D design, product design/ manufactoring, and computer animation. I have hopes of beginning the Creative Technology and Design master's program for the Fall of 2023 where I can combine my knowledge of both my undergraduate major and minor. <br> <br> Outside of school and work, I love spending time with my family and friends, listening to music, and doing all of the basic Colorado girl stuff-- hiking, hammocking, and skiing. </div>
