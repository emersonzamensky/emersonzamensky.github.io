 <div class="title"> City Compost Hubs/Farms </div>


<div class="text"> The project of creating community farms/ compost hubs around Oakland was presented to us from the City as a way of engaging the community, providing a green service, and keeping on track with SB 1383 (see Compost and Wildfire Mitigation page to learn more about this bill). To further connect with the community and allow this project to become more widespread, my team also created an ArcGIS StoryMap of the community farms equipped with corresponding information for each hub, as well as a project overview. <br> <br> Learn more about the project background, concept, goal(s), and implementation process through this StoryMap embedded below, alongside our presentation to City stakeholders.
