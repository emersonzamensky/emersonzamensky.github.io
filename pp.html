 <div class="title"> Ping Pong Ball Holder </div>


<div class="text"> I learned the basic ins and outs of CAD and 3D printing through taking "Form" within the CTD minor. This project was not for an assignment but something I thought could be useful to my roommates and I. <br> <br> This ping pong ball holder holds six ping pong balls and allows for easy access as once a ball is grabbed from the bottom, the one above it takes its place. It has indeed proven useful. Next time I have white filament available I'm going to reprint and paint this bad boy. </div>
