 <div class="title"> Accessible Ski Jacket </div>


<div class="text"> I took the class "Object" through the CTD minor my senior year for a few weeks until deciding to drop it due to schedule issues and credit overload. In those few weeks I got a introduction into the world of physical computing. This entailed the basics of Arduino, circuit building, and working with simple sensors and motors. I absolutely loved this combination of creativity and engineering and designing new ways for humans to interact with the world around us. I was inspired to keep creating using the skills that I learned in that short time. <br> <br> I was skiing at Eldora a year or two ago when I came across a blind skier accompanied by six "watch skiers". I was equally baffled and impressed that someone would partake in such an active, difficult and potentially dangerous sport as skiing without the ability to see. It's amazing that six people were there to help him as well, especially because that cannot be an easy feat. So I thought, what could make the job of everyone involved a little easier? What could improve upon his interaction with the environment? <br> <br> This (work in progress) project is something I did outside of school. It is a distance detecting buzzer sewn into a ski jacket (if I could afford another ski jacket I would have actually done this part) that is meant to alert a blind skier of how close they are to something, i.e a tree, another person, etc. The closer they get, the faster the sesnor buzzes. While this does not take away the need for watch skiers, it allows the blind skier to feel more in control and more in touch with their environment. <br> <br> I am sill fairly new to Arduino and the whole concept of physical computing. Below is the skematic alongside my board. I'm having trouble getting my code to work and am afraid I probably won't be able to without some help. Despite these issues, I am very excited about the potential of this project, getting it work, and improving it along the way! <br> <br> Schematic photo taken from https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Distance-Detector-with-a-Buzzer-and-LEDs/ </div>
