 <div class="title"> Embroidered Temperature Gauge </div>


<div class="text"> I took the class "Object" through the CTD minor my senior year for a few weeks until deciding to drop it due to schedule issues and credit overload. In those few weeks I got a introduction into the world of physical computing. This entailed the basics of Arduino, circuit building, and working with simple sensors and motors. I absolutely loved this combination of creativity and engineering and designing new ways for humans to interact with the world around them. I was inspired to keep creating using the skills that I learned in that short time. <br> <br> I have always loved the combination of creativity and art with technology and engineering that ATLAS is built upon. I recently started embroidering in my free time as a new creative outlet and thought that giving my creations a purpose (outside of being pretty in a cleary beginner looking way) would be a fun task.  <br> <br> This (work in progress) project is something I did outside of school. I embroidered a temperature/humidity sensor into the fabric of a complete embroidery of mine. It is simply meant to be a fun, eye-catching and unique way of looking at the temperature and humidity. <br> <br> I am sill fairly new to Arduino and the whole concept of physical computing. Below is the skematic alongside my board. I'm having trouble getting my code to work and am afraid I probably won't be able to without some help. The sensor turns on, but does not give me the readings. Despite these issues, I am very excited about getting this project to work, as I'm sure this a simple fix for an Arduino regular. I'd like to make more of these for my friends and family members as well! <br> <br> Schematic taken from https://projecthub.arduino.cc/adrakhmat/b4b75bd1-c915-40d9-971b-b7bdf787efe5?ref=search&ref_id=temperature%20and%20humidity%20display&offset=7</div>
