 <div class="title"> Time to Shine App </div>


<div class="text"> This was a group project for "Design Foundations". We were tasked with creating an app (with some parameters that I'm forgetting now) but relating some how to the passage of time and humans' relartionship with time in general. I really enjoyed the process of this project because it allowed me to observe parts of the world around me that I wouldn't nomrally do. Having to do this during COVID honeslty made it even more entertaining to me. I remember sitting in my car having to watch students on campus and write about their behavior, how the time passing felt for me, etc. Our app reflects all of our experiences with these pre project assignments. It's meant to make time feel less confining and fleating, but rather something that we can take advantage of. </div>
